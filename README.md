# PDF-Text-to-HTML
A small script written to read a PDF file and convert the text contents into a html file

This python file reads all text or PDF files within current directory,\
then parse the contents according to a special rule to interpret where the new line character might be,\
and output to a .htm file.


## Reason why this exists
I read English slow and the browser translation tool doesn't work on PDF file :3

Ya that's about it
